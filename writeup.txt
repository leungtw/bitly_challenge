Design Decisions
    Language: Python, HTML, CSS
    Framework: Flask
When it comes to working with website and website requests, I only have experience implementing servers using Python and PHP. Python, especially through Flask, is very easy to integrate with HTML.

Exposed Endpoints
    The only exposed endpoint is the access key that is asked for on index.html.
